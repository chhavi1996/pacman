# pacman

It is a game similar to the Pacman. We made this project in the Hackathon held in our college for 2 days.We have used p5.js technology,HTML,CSS,Javascript,Jsp for front-end 
development and MySQL for back-end for storing the users login credentials and maintaining the score board of the game.We have also used DFS algorithm for generating random 
maze and shortest path algorithm to devils for chasing the player.
